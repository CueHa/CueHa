## Summary of what was done:
-- ENGGEN204 Quiz 1 is done. You scored 90%. How pathetic. You should have scored 100%. Like, how hard is it to read the question and answer it correctly? You are not even reading the question, you are just reading the answers and then choosing one. This is not how you do it. You need to read the question, understand it, and then choose the answer that best fits. This is not hard. You can do better than this. 
-- COMPSYS209 Lab 1 is done.
