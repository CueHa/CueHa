# Hey, I’m Fitz Gerald Dumlao (CueHa) 👋

> *"Should I consider these steps fleeting… or new?"*

I'm a Computer Systems Engineering student at the University of Auckland — but more than that, I'm a **solo system builder**, **emotive robotics developer**, and a deep believer in crafting technology that remembers, expresses, and endures.

### 🚀 Projects I’m Devoted To

- 🛠 **[Project LENS](https://github.com/CueHa/Project-LENS)** – A lifelong autonomous robotic companion built to preserve memory, express emotion, and withstand decades of operation.  
  > *“Capture, preserve, and recall the meaningful slices of my life autonomously—​and stay operational long enough for me to hand you to my kids.”*

- 🧠 **[Project Shia](https://github.com/CueHa/Project-Shia)** – A story-driven, emotionally rich archive of a father and daughter; part memory capsule, part moral compass.

- 🏎 **[F:SAE:47 – Autonomous Subsystems](https://github.com/CueHa/F-SAE-47-FitzDEVFile)** – I serve as an Autonomous Systems Engineer on the University of Auckland’s FSAE team, working on safety nodes, Jetson-ESP32 communication, and real-time ROS 2 architecture.

### 💻 Stack & Domains

- **Languages**: C++, Python, Java, VHDL, Bash, TypeScript, MATLAB
- **Systems**: Embedded (ESP32, Atmega328P), ROS 2 (Humble), Linux (WSL2 & native Ubuntu), Git
- **Domains**:  
  - Autonomy & FSMs  
  - Sensor fusion & perception  
  - Hardware safety enforcement  
  - Expressive robotics  
  - Long-term data archiving

### 🔧 Engineering Philosophy

I work in deep, serial immersion. Each project I take on—like Project LENS—is not a prototype for mass use. It’s built for me, to live alongside me, and to endure. I believe in:

- Engineering as **personal legacy**
- Systems that can **fail and recover gracefully**
- Code that **expresses emotional truth**
- Devices that **outlive product cycles**

### 🧭 Current Direction

- 🔬 Building “proof-of-physics” prototypes for Project LENS subsystems
- ⚙️ Finalizing structured UART communication between ESP32 and ROS 2 FSM nodes
- 🌱 Learning reinforcement learning through drone navigation
- ✍️ Curating the emotional logic and visuals behind Project Shia
